Utilizing the 96-bit ItronÂ® Standard Consumption Message protocol (SCM), the C1SR
provides the energy (kWh) consumption, module ID number, tamper indications, meter
type, and error checking information in each radio frequency transmission. Within the 96
-bit SCM, 26 bits are allocated to the module ID number for meter identification (also
referred to as ERT ID number). As of October 15, 1999, all CENTRON C1SR meters utilize 26
-bit identification numbers.
The C1SR uses frequency hopping and transmits within the unlicensed 910 to 920 MHz
band on an average of once per second. In order to avoid interference from other devices,
the transmission frequencies and time interval between transmission cycles are completely
random in nature.

The RF transmission is spread spectrum using Binary Phase Shift Keyed (BPSK) modulation. A chipping signal
is used to spread the carrier and actual data is on-off-keyed (OOK). The modulator output drives the
amplifier chain that provides a signal of approximately 100mW. The antenna is tuned for maximum efficiency
at the carrier frequency
